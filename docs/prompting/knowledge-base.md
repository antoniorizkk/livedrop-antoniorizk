# Shoplite Knowledge Base

## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process
To create a Shoplite account, users visit the registration page and provide their email address, password, and profile information such as full name and phone number. Email verification is mandatory within 24 hours to activate the account. Users can choose between two types: a buyer account (free and immediate) or a seller account (requires business verification including tax ID and proof of ownership). Shoplite enforces strong password requirements with at least eight characters, a number, and a symbol. Account recovery options are available through both email and SMS authentication. Security notifications are sent when suspicious login activity is detected. Users may also enable two-factor authentication for added security. For sellers, additional onboarding steps include submitting business documents, waiting for manual review, and accepting Shoplite’s seller terms. Once approved, sellers gain access to inventory management and payment setup tools. Shoplite accounts are protected by industry-standard encryption to safeguard user data.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features
The Shoplite shopping cart allows users to add products from multiple sellers, save items for later, and apply promotional codes during checkout. Cart contents are preserved across sessions for logged-in users, while guest carts expire after 24 hours. Each item in the cart displays the seller, price, estimated delivery time, and applicable discounts. Users can update quantities, remove products, or move items to their wish list. A built-in price calculator updates totals in real time, showing shipping fees, taxes, and any active discount codes. If inventory runs out, the cart automatically notifies users before checkout. Items saved for later are not reserved, ensuring fair availability across all buyers. The cart supports multi-currency pricing depending on the user’s region. For sellers, the cart integrates with inventory systems to lock stock once a checkout is initiated, preventing overselling. The cart also includes an upsell feature, recommending similar or complementary products.

## Document 3: Shoplite Checkout and Payment Security
Shoplite’s checkout process is designed for both convenience and safety. Users can choose guest checkout or log into their account for faster processing. At checkout, shipping details are validated in real time, and the system calculates estimated delivery dates based on user location. Payment options include credit/debit cards, PayPal, digital wallets, and Shoplite’s own gift cards. All transactions are processed through PCI-DSS-compliant gateways with end-to-end encryption. Users are redirected to secure payment providers for sensitive input, minimizing risk. Fraud detection algorithms flag unusual activity, such as mismatched billing addresses or repeated failed transactions. Buyers can save preferred payment methods in their account, secured with tokenization. Shoplite offers one-click checkout for logged-in users with verified addresses and payment methods. To protect sellers, funds are held temporarily until delivery confirmation or after a defined protection window. Refunds, chargebacks, and disputes are handled under strict financial compliance protocols.

## Document 4: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery
After checkout, buyers receive an order confirmation email with an estimated delivery date. Each order is assigned a tracking number, accessible via the user’s account dashboard. Shoplite integrates with major logistics providers, updating status in real time. Buyers can view stages such as “Order Confirmed,” “Packed,” “Shipped,” and “Delivered.” Notifications are sent by email and in-app push alerts when key events occur. In case of delays, automated alerts inform buyers with revised estimates. For sellers, the system enforces timely shipment deadlines and issues penalties for late dispatches. Sellers can upload tracking numbers directly, which sync with the buyer’s account. For orders with multiple items, partial shipments are supported, with separate tracking for each package. Buyers may opt into delivery preferences, such as requiring a signature or leaving the package at a pickup location. Shoplite’s delivery system prioritizes transparency and ensures both buyers and sellers are informed at every stage.

## Document 5: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies
Shoplite maintains a buyer-friendly return policy designed to balance customer trust with seller protection. Buyers can initiate returns within 14 days of delivery, provided the item is unused, in original packaging, and includes proof of purchase. Certain categories, such as digital goods, perishable items, and hygiene-sensitive products, are non-returnable. Refunds are issued back to the original payment method within 5–7 business days after seller approval. If sellers fail to respond within 3 business days, Shoplite automatically approves the return. Disputes are escalated to Shoplite’s resolution team, which mediates between buyer and seller. Return shipping costs may be covered by the seller or deducted from the refund, depending on seller settings. For defective or incorrect items, full refunds including shipping are guaranteed. Sellers receive detailed analytics on return rates to help identify quality issues. Shoplite enforces these rules to maintain fair trade while minimizing abuse.

## Document 6: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings
Product reviews allow buyers to share feedback, build trust, and guide purchasing decisions. After order delivery, buyers are invited to rate items on a five-star scale and provide optional written feedback. Shoplite verifies that only buyers who completed a purchase can leave reviews, reducing fake or spam content. Reviews are public and visible on product pages, with the ability to sort by most recent or most helpful. Sellers can respond to reviews publicly, addressing concerns or thanking customers. Negative reviews trigger automated alerts, encouraging sellers to improve service. Shoplite also uses AI moderation tools to detect offensive language and spam. Aggregate ratings affect product ranking in search results and seller reputation scores. Verified reviews display a special badge to indicate authenticity. Buyers may also upload product photos, further enhancing credibility. Reviews contribute to community trust, and consistent poor ratings may trigger seller performance reviews or penalties.

## Document 8: Shoplite Inventory Management
Inventory management on Shoplite ensures accurate stock levels and prevents overselling. Sellers can manually update quantities or integrate through Shoplite’s API for automated synchronization with external systems. When an item’s stock falls below a predefined threshold, Shoplite sends low-inventory alerts. Products automatically display “Out of Stock” once quantities reach zero. Bulk upload tools allow sellers to manage large catalogs efficiently using CSV or API endpoints. The system supports variants such as size, color, and bundle packs. Reserved stock is automatically deducted when a buyer initiates checkout but is released if payment fails or the session expires. For sellers with warehouses in multiple regions, Shoplite supports geo-based inventory, ensuring buyers see availability in their area. Reports provide insights into sales velocity and inventory turnover. Shoplite enforces strict penalties for sellers who repeatedly oversell, as this harms buyer trust and platform reputation.

## Document 9: Shoplite Commission and Fees
Shoplite operates on a commission-based model supplemented by service fees. Standard commission rates vary between 8% and 15%, depending on the product category. High-demand categories, such as electronics, may have slightly higher rates, while books and media enjoy reduced fees. In addition, sellers pay a fixed transaction fee per completed order. Premium sellers who meet specific performance criteria may qualify for reduced commissions. Shoplite also offers subscription plans for high-volume sellers, providing access to advanced analytics, advertising tools, and priority customer support. All fees are deducted automatically before disbursement of seller earnings. Shoplite maintains full transparency by providing detailed invoices, accessible in the Seller Dashboard. Sellers must account for these costs when pricing products. Late shipment penalties and dispute resolution fees may also apply. Shoplite’s fee structure is reviewed annually to ensure competitiveness while funding platform development and operational security.

## Document 15: Shoplite Developer Best Practices
Shoplite encourages developers to follow best practices when integrating with the platform. Proper error handling is essential, with retries implemented for temporary failures. Developers should minimize API calls by caching responses where possible. Authentication tokens must be stored securely and refreshed before expiration. Sensitive information, such as API keys, must never be hard-coded. Applications should respect rate limits to avoid throttling. Shoplite recommends using webhooks for event-driven integrations instead of constant polling. Developers should validate input thoroughly to prevent injection attacks or data corruption. For UI integrations, Shoplite advises following accessibility guidelines and providing multilingual support. Automated testing in sandbox environments ensures smooth deployments. Documentation updates should be monitored regularly, as deprecations may occur. Developers are also encouraged to join the Shoplite developer community to exchange knowledge and gain access to early beta features. Following these practices improves reliability and security of integrations.
