# Shoplite Knowledge Base

## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process
To create a Shoplite account, users navigate to the registration page and provide an email address, password, and minimal profile information (name and country). Shoplite supports two primary account types: Buyer and Seller. Buyer accounts are free and require email verification within 24 hours. Seller accounts require additional business information (company name, tax ID, business address) and a document upload step for verification. During seller registration, the system performs an automated identity check followed by a manual review for higher-risk accounts. Password rules enforce a minimum length and complexity; the system supports passwordless login options (email magic links) and two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS or authenticator apps. Users can manage their profiles in Account Settings: update email, change password, enable 2FA, and adjust notification preferences. Account deletion is available under Privacy Settings and triggers a data retention workflow (30 days grace period before full deletion). For security and compliance, Shoplite stores hashed passwords and enforces rate limits on registration and login attempts to mitigate automated abuse. When switching between Buyer and Seller roles (if allowed in a market), users may need to submit additional documentation and accept seller terms. The registration process integrates with KYC providers where mandated by regulation, and the UI clearly shows expected verification timelines and next steps. Common user issues (email not received, failed verification) are handled by resending verification tokens and showing diagnostic messages in the UI.

## Document 2: Product Search and Filtering Features
Shoplite search is designed for speed, relevance, and predictable filter behavior. The search service uses a hybrid approach: lexical indexing (for exact matches and prefixes), synonym mapping (to handle common alternate terms), and optional semantic reranking for enhanced relevance. The product catalog exposes fields used for search: title, description, SKU, brand, category, tags, and attributes (size, color). Search supports typeahead suggestions, fuzzy match for typos, and advanced operators (e.g., "brand:Acme price:<50"). Faceted filters allow users to refine results by category, brand, price range, rating, availability, and seller. Sorting options include relevance, price (low→high, high→low), newest arrivals, and top-rated. The retrieval pipeline includes a pre-filter stage to restrict candidates by availability and seller status, and a post-rank stage for business rules (promoted items, sponsored listings). Pagination uses a cursor-based approach for consistent paging. For performance, high-volume prefixes and common queries are cached with short TTLs; cold queries fall back to the index. Search integrates with inventory management to hide or mark out-of-stock items and supports attribute-level filtering across variations. For international markets, language tokenization and localized synonyms are supported; relevancy tuning is region-specific. Analytics capture query patterns, zero-result queries, and click-through rates to allow iterative tuning. Finally, the UI surfaces "Did you mean..." suggestions and related search prompts to reduce friction and help users reach products faster.

## Document 3: Shopping Cart and Checkout Process
The Shoplite shopping cart is persistent for logged-in users and session-backed for guests. Users can add items from multiple sellers into a single cart; each line item includes SKU, seller, unit price, tax estimate, and available promotions. The cart enforces quantity limits based on available inventory and reserves stock during active checkout windows to prevent oversell. Checkout supports a multi-step flow: shipping address selection, shipping method choice (standard, expedited, pickup), payment method selection, and final review. Shipping cost calculation is performed in real time using seller-defined shipping rules, third-party carrier APIs, and rate tables. Promo codes and seller-level discounts are applied during review; discounts indicate whether they are stackable and whether they alter seller payouts. Taxes are computed by jurisdiction using configured tax rules and passed to the invoice. Payment flow supports saved payment methods (tokenized), guest checkout with card entry, and redirect flows for alternative payment providers. After payment authorization, the system captures payment and transitions the order to "Processing," then notifies the seller(s) and triggers fulfillment workflows. Order confirmation includes an order id, line-item summary, payment receipt, and expected delivery windows. For multi-seller orders, Shoplite aggregates shipment details and may separate shipments per seller. The cart also offers "save for later" and "share cart" features. Timeouts and optimistic locking ensure consistent cart state during concurrent sessions. Errors during payment generate a clear recovery path (retry, change payment method, contact support). Analytics track abandon rate at each checkout step to guide UX improvements.

## Document 4: Payment Methods and Security
Shoplite supports multiple payment methods to maximize conversion: major credit/debit cards via PCI-compliant gateways, tokenized saved cards, digital wallets (where available), and local payment methods (bank transfer, cash-on-delivery in supported markets). All card payments are processed using an external PCI-DSS-compliant payment gateway; sensitive card data is never stored on Shoplite servers—only gateway tokens are retained. For added security, Shoplite supports 3-D Secure (3DS) flows to reduce fraud liability and leverages risk-based authentication where the gateway supports it. Payment operations are split into authorize and capture phases for marketplace flows that require pre-authorization before final capture. Refunds, partial refunds, and chargeback handling are supported via gateway APIs and are tied to order and settlement records so sellers and buyers have a clear audit trail. Fraud detection incorporates rule-based checks (geolocation mismatch, velocity checks, IP reputation) and optional third-party fraud scoring services. All payment-related network traffic is encrypted in transit using TLS; database fields for tokens and settlement data are encrypted at rest. Payouts to sellers are performed on a configurable settlement schedule with reconciliation processes and dispute handling. Webhooks from payment providers are validated and retried, and payment-related errors feed into monitoring and alerting. Administrative dashboards provide payment reconciliation, refund initiation, and chargeback management tools for operations teams.

## Document 5: Order Tracking and Delivery
Shoplite’s order tracking system provides real-time status progression and integrates with seller fulfillment workflows and third-party carriers. Standard order statuses include: Pending, Processing, Shipped, In Transit, Out for Delivery, Delivered, and Exception (delayed, lost). For sellers who provide carrier tracking numbers, Shoplite stores the tracking URL and displays live progress to buyers by querying carrier APIs or using webhook updates. Partial shipments are supported: each shipment line has a shipment id, shipped quantity, carrier, and tracking number. Estimated delivery windows are calculated using seller-provided handling times combined with carrier transit estimates and are shown on the order confirmation and order detail pages. International shipments include customs clearance stages; Shoplite presents customs estimates, duties, and potential delays where applicable. Notification preferences (email, SMS, push) determine how frequently users receive updates. If a carrier reports an exception, Shoplite surfaces the issue to both buyer and seller and flags the order for customer support review. Sellers are responsible for shipment labeling and drop-off unless fulfillment by Shoplite (FBS) or integrated third-party fulfillment is used. Delivery SLA and shipping cost are visible at checkout. For returns and carrier disputes, the order tracking history is part of the dispute dossier. The tracking system exposes an internal API for partner integrations and supports webhook callbacks so external services and sellers can react to status changes.

## Document 6: Return and Refund Policies
Shoplite implements a standardized return and refund policy that is adaptable by seller, while ensuring consumer protections. Default buyer-facing policy is a 30-day return window for most products from the date of delivery; certain categories (perishables, personalized items) are excluded or have shorter windows. Returns require a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) issued through the order page; the system collects return reason, photos (if required), and preferred refund method. Sellers can configure whether return shipping is seller-paid, buyer-paid, or platform-assisted (Shoplite generates a prepaid return label). Upon receipt and inspection of returned goods, sellers confirm condition and issue refunds to the original payment method; partial refunds may be issued if items are damaged beyond restocking thresholds. Refund timelines differ by payment method and gateway processing times; Shoplite displays expected refund completion windows to buyers. For lost-in-transit or non-delivery claims, buyers can open an investigation; if the claim is validated, Shoplite issues reimbursement per policy and works with carriers on claims. Fraud prevention measures (photo validation, item serial number checks) help mitigate abuse. Marketplace metrics include return rate by seller and product, which inform seller performance scoring and potential policy changes. Sellers with consistently high return rates receive guidance or temporary restrictions. Dispute escalation routes involve platform mediation, with a documented appeals process and required evidence submissions.

## Document 7: Product Reviews and Ratings
Shoplite’s review system enables buyers to leave star ratings (1–5) and written reviews for products they purchased. Reviews are tied to verified purchases to increase trust; the system uses purchase history to flag verified-status and prevent review manipulation. Review submission includes rating, title, body, optional images, and consent to publishing. Automated moderation filters check for spam, profanity, personally identifiable information, and externally-hosted links; flagged reviews are routed to human moderators for adjudication. Rating aggregation calculates an average rating displayed on product listing and search results with transparent rating counts. Sellers and buyers can respond to reviews; response threads are displayed under the review to encourage dialogue. Shoplite supports review incentives (e.g., discount for writing a review) provided they are disclosed and do not bias content. To ensure fairness, review weighting accounts for recency and reviewer credibility but does not hide lower ratings. For high-volume categories, duplicate detection and semantic similarity checks reduce redundant content. Reviews influence search ranking and merchandising signals; extreme outlier reviews can trigger product quality audits. Users can report reviews for violations; repeat offenders face account penalties. Data retention policies maintain review records for auditing and compliance.

## Document 8: Seller Account Setup and Management
Seller onboarding begins at the seller registration portal where applicants submit business details, contact information, tax identifiers, and required documentation (business license, proof of identity). The onboarding workflow includes automated checks for sanctioned lists, tax compliance, and shipping capability. New sellers choose subscription tiers or pay-as-you-go plans, which determine available features, listing limits, and commission rates. Once approved, sellers access a dashboard with tools for product listing creation (single and bulk CSV or API upload), inventory management, order processing, pricing tools, promotions, and performance analytics. Sellers configure SKU-level fulfillment options, return preferences, and shipping templates with regional rules and carrier integrations. The dashboard provides granular reports: sales, returns, refunds, disputes, and settlement reports. Seller performance metrics—on-time shipping, cancellation rate, and return rate—feed into a seller score; low-scoring sellers receive notifications and remediation guidance. Payment setup requires bank account verification for payouts and adherence to settlement schedules. Sellers can invite team members and assign roles (catalog manager, order processor, finance). APIs allow sellers to connect external ERPs or inventory systems. Compliance controls enable platform admins to suspend listings or accounts for policy violations. For marketplaces with regional restrictions, geofencing and tax configurations ensure sellers only list products in supported markets. The onboarding pipeline supports staged rollouts, allowing some sellers to be onboarded in pilot cohorts before full access.

## Document 9: Inventory Management for Sellers
Inventory management in Shoplite centers on SKU granularity and availability synchronization. Each SKU has stock level, reserved quantity (for pending orders), lead time, warehouse location, and optional safety stock. Sellers update inventory through a web dashboard, bulk CSV uploads, or API endpoints; integrations with third-party ERP/WMS systems are supported for automatic sync. The platform supports multi-warehouse setups and per-warehouse routing based on buyer location and shipping cost optimization. Inventory rules include reorder thresholds (triggering alerts), backorder policies, and auto-disable for zero-stock SKUs to prevent new purchases unless backorder is allowed. During checkout, the system performs a final availability check and reserves stock for a configurable hold period; if payment fails or the checkout window expires, reserved quantities are released. Stock adjustments (manual counts, returns, canceled orders) follow an audit trail for reconciliation and appear in inventory aging reports. For high-volume sellers, incremental sync endpoints and webhooks provide efficient updates; delta uploads minimize bandwidth. Inventory forecasting features leverage historical sales to suggest reorder quantities. For multi-channel sellers, Shoplite provides a centralized inventory ledger to prevent overselling across platforms. Sellers can also configure fulfillment preferences (split by warehouse or seller fulfillment service) and enable automatic routing to fulfillment partners when thresholds are met.

## Document 10: Commission and Fee Structure
Shoplite’s fee model balances platform revenue with seller value. Core components include a transaction commission (percentage of item price), payment processing fee (gateway cost passed through or partially subsidized), optional listing or subscription fees for premium seller tiers, and additional service fees for fulfillment, advertising, or chargeback handling. Commission percentages vary by category and seller tier and are transparent in the seller agreement. Commission calculations run per-order line item after discounts and before taxes; fees are shown in the seller settlement reports. Shoplite supports promotional subsidization where the platform absorbs part of the fee for promotional campaigns. For marketplaces operating in regulated jurisdictions, VAT or GST is applied per tax rules and reflected in payout computations. Settlement cycles (daily, weekly, monthly) are configurable by market and shown in the payout schedule; the platform holds funds under escrow until funds are cleared and return windows are observed. Disputes and chargebacks reduce the payable balance until resolution; chargeback reserve policies may temporarily withhold a portion of seller payouts. Fees for optional services (fulfillment, advertising) are itemized and billable separately. Sellers can view detailed fee breakdowns in the dashboard and reconcile with monthly statements. Fee changes are announced with notice periods per seller agreement.

## Document 11: Customer Support Procedures
Shoplite provides multi-channel customer support: in-app chat, email, phone (limited hours), and a help center with articles and guided flows. Support tiers are defined: general buyer support, seller operations support, and escalations for policy disputes or security incidents. Customer requests are triaged automatically using intent classifiers and routing rules: urgent issues (fraud, lost funds) are prioritized for human agents; routine queries (order status, returns) are handled by the RAG-powered assistant or scripted responses. Support agents use a unified agent console showing order context, customer history, and suggested responses. SLAs define response times per channel and severity level; the platform tracks time to first response, resolution time, and CSAT. Escalation workflows include supervisor review, platform mediation, and case tracking with evidence attachment. For seller support, operational dashboards expose fulfillment queues and exception reports. Training materials and canned responses for common scenarios reduce response variability. For data-sensitive requests (account deletion, payment disputes), agents follow additional verification steps. All support interactions are logged and used to improve knowledge articles and automated assistant prompts. The support system integrates with monitoring and alerting to surface systemic issues (e.g., payment gateway outages) to both support and engineering teams.

## Document 12: Mobile App Features
Shoplite mobile apps (iOS and Android) are feature-parity with core web functionality while optimizing for touch, offline resilience, and native capabilities. Core features include browsing and search with voice and camera-based search (image-to-product lookup), one-tap purchase via stored tokens, push notifications for orders and promotions, and an in-app wallet for local payment methods. The app caches recently viewed items and cart contents for offline continuity; on reconnect, it reconciles changes and notifies users of any inventory adjustments. Native features include biometric login (FaceID/TouchID), barcode scanning for product lookup or seller onboarding, and share intents for social sharing. The mobile UI prioritizes conversion patterns: quick-add to cart, streamlined checkout, and adaptive rating prompts after purchase. Deep links support marketing campaigns and partner integrations. For sellers, mobile tools include quick order fulfillment marks, instant messaging with buyers, and basic inventory adjustments. App performance is monitored via crash logs and UX metrics; updates follow staged rollouts. Push notification preferences are customizable; SMS is available as an alternative. The app implements lightweight analytics for personalized recommendations without shipping PII in analytic events.

## Document 13: API Documentation for Developers
Shoplite exposes RESTful and GraphQL APIs for integrating catalogs, orders, carts, and seller workflows. Core endpoints include product listing (`GET /api/v1/products`), product detail (`GET /api/v1/products/{id}`), search (`GET /api/v1/search`), cart (`POST /api/v1/carts`, `GET/PUT /api/v1/carts/{id}`), checkout (`POST /api/v1/orders`), order retrieval (`GET /api/v1/orders/{id}`), and webhook registration (`POST /api/v1/webhooks`). Authentication uses OAuth2 (client credentials for server-to-server and authorization code for user flows) and token scopes limit access. APIs paginate results using cursor-based tokens, return standardized error codes with helpful messages, and include rate limits per API key. Webhooks notify external systems about order status changes, inventory updates, and payments; webhook payloads include signatures for verification. API responses follow JSON:API conventions for consistency. Developer onboarding includes API keys, sandbox endpoints, SDKs for common languages, and sample code snippets for typical flows (product sync, order processing). API versioning follows semantic conventions and deprecation windows are communicated in advance. For large catalog uploads, bulk endpoints or chunked uploads are available; asynchronous job endpoints provide status and logs. Error handling best practices are documented along with retry strategies and idempotency keys for safe retries.

## Document 14: Security and Privacy Policies
Shoplite adheres to security-by-design principles and privacy regulations applicable to its operating markets. Personal data collection is limited to what is necessary for order fulfillment, payments, and legal compliance. Data processing follows role-based access control and least-privilege practices; administrative actions are audited. Sensitive data (payment tokens, personal identifiers) are encrypted at rest and in transit. The platform maintains an incident response plan, vulnerability management program (regular pentests and patching schedules), and a responsible disclosure policy for security researchers. Privacy controls include user consent for marketing communications, options for data export, and account deletion workflows that respect retention and legal hold obligations. For international operations, Shoplite implements data transfer safeguards (standard contractual clauses, local data residency where required). Access to production systems uses multi-factor authentication and ephemeral credentials; secrets are managed via a secrets manager and rotated regularly. Logging and monitoring detect abnormal behavior; security alerts are tied to on-call rotations. Compliance certifications (where present) are maintained and documented for partners. The privacy policy explains data categories collected, processing purposes, retention periods, and user rights such as data access, rectification, and erasure.

## Document 15: Promotional Codes and Discounts
Shoplite supports flexible promotional mechanisms to drive acquisition and conversion. Promo codes can be global, category-specific, seller-specific, or user-targeted. Types include percentage off, fixed amount off, buy-one-get-one (BOGO), free shipping, and tiered discounts (e.g., $10 off orders over $100). Promo rules define applicability (product/skus, categories), combinability (stackable or exclusive), minimum spend, and start/end dates. Redemption limits can be set per user, per promotion, or globally. Promotions are evaluated during cart pricing with clear precedence: item-level promos apply before cart-level promos unless configured otherwise. Coupons integrate with reporting for uplift analysis and fraud prevention (abuse heuristics such as mass redemptions or multiple accounts). Targeted promotions use audience attributes (loyalty tier, past purchase behavior) and must respect privacy choices. Promo creation includes staging and preview features so merchants can test before publishing. When a promotion affects seller payouts, the accounting engine records how discounts are allocated across sellers to maintain transparent settlements. Promo redemptions are visible in order and settlement reports, and expired or invalid code attempts surface actionable messages to users. Administrative controls allow revocation of promotions and retroactive adjustments when required by policy or error.
