Endpoints cover product listing, inventory management, order retrieval, payment confirmation, and account management. Rate limits are enforced to prevent abuse, with higher thresholds available for enterprise partners. Documentation includes example requests and responses in JSON format, with error codes clearly defined. Sandbox environments are available for testing before production deployment. Developers must register applications within their Shoplite account to receive client IDs and secrets. API updates are versioned, ensuring backward compatibility. Shoplite also provides SDKs in popular languages like Python, JavaScript, and PHP. Webhooks enable real-time updates on events such as order creation or shipment status. Developer support includes forums, tutorials, and dedicated technical assistance for enterprise clients.\"\n",

Developers should minimize API calls by caching responses where possible. Authentication tokens must be stored securely and refreshed before expiration. Sensitive information, such as API keys, must never be hard-coded. Applications should respect rate limits to avoid throttling. Shoplite recommends using webhooks for event-driven integrations instead of constant polling. Developers should validate input thoroughly to prevent injection attacks or data corruption. For UI integrations, Shoplite advises following accessibility guidelines and providing multilingual support. Automated testing in sandbox environments ensures smooth deployments. Documentation updates should be monitored regularly, as deprecations may occur. Developers are also encouraged to join the Shoplite developer community to exchange knowledge and gain access to early beta features. Following these practices improves reliability and security of integrations.\"\n",
